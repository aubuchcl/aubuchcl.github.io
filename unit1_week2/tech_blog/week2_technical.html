			I was going to try to make a reference to the popularity of goldeneye in the 90s to javascript, but I think a much better comparison would be javascript and Joan Rivers.

			You see, Joan Rivers is a staple in entertainment.  She has been around for a long time and lots of people love her.  She is charismatic, funny, outgoing, pretty, and not getting any younger.  There are a lot of viewers that don't agree with her choice to get lots of plastic surgery to keep herself beautiful and looking young.  There are people who cheer the same decisions.  My point is that Joan Rivers, like her on not, is an industry standard in entertainment reporting.

			So what does Joan Rivers have to do with the popularity of Jscript.  Let me first thank you for reading this far into a blog with a rediculous premise, I appreciate you.	 The relation, you see, is that not a ton of people love Jscript.  People moan about it and say that it should go away soon.  The problem is that it is a staple in the web development industry.  It was solidified years ago, not because of netscape (imo), but when internet explorer v3.0 accepted it and then went on to take over the world.  Just like Joan getting plastic surgery to stay looking younger, Jscript got the Jquery library that kept it looking new and pretty and made it easier to work with.  Almost every red carpet event has Joan covering the event on some network and on almost every computer in the world jscript has an interpreter installed.

			In reality programming languages seem to become more popular as their becomes more documentation and community support built around them.  Jscript, I think, almost benefitted from its cluncky user unfriendly nature.  It forced people to come up with and share different ways of working with the framwork and from that pursuit, there is now an unbelieveable amount of resources built around jscript.  The main resource has got to be the Jquery library.  Either way, jscript is here to stay for quite a while.  Just like Joan Rivers :).
