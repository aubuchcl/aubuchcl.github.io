			I chose competition.  I chose this value because for me it is what drives my personal valence when I am doing somthing.  If I cannot compete I really don’t have much fun.  Also I think it is the best way to learn.  When you win you can teach others how they could have done something better, and when you lose you have the opportunity to learn.  You can even watch others compete and learn from the way they play each other.

				<li>Competition (5)</li>
				<li>Knowledge (5)</li>

			The last time someone asked my advice on a topic was earlier this morning.  The advice was about some ambitions my friend was having for the summer and next winter.  I don’t know that he really wanted my advice or even cared if I approved.  I think that what he wanted was for me to listen to his plan and agree that it was a plan and it could be done.  The advice that he wanted was encouragement.  It didn’t matter that it wasn’t the best plan.  He wasn’t worried about exactly how he was going to do some of the small things.  He was excited about the idea of pursuing something and just wanted to hear someone else agree that it wasn’t crazy or not viable.  So my advice ended up being, reinforcing what he already knew he had to do.  I listened and reiterated over what he said and then reminded him that he would be responsible for making these things happen.
