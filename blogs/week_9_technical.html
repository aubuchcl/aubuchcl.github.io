			<strong>Overview</strong><br>
			TDD is test driven development.  It is the process of writing test code to signify the amount of change you want to make.  This is driven by the idea that you want to have a full understanding of the changes you want to make, you should be able to phrase these changes as a driver code that will lead the code changes you want to make.  Most people would agree that test first development with refactoring makes up test driven development.  After you write your test code and change the code to add more abilities to your code you must refactor the code you have written to reflect best practices and to minimize its overall usage effects.

			<strong>So why really would we use TDD</strong><br>
			One of the biggest reasons to use TDD is that it will allow you to make as many or as few (as small or big) of changes as you would like.  A quote I like is <br>
			I think Bob Martin says it well “The act of writing a unit test is more an act of design than of verification.  It is also more an act of documentation than of verification.  The act of writing a unit test closes a remarkable number of feedback loops, the least of which is the one pertaining to verification of function”

			<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
			So what is TDD really.  In the most basic sense it is writing driver code that will fail and then using that driver code as a base to write new code that will pass the test.  This process really is the best way to approach large scale change seeing as it provides a stable platform to operate off of.  It makes the test drive the eventual outcome and centers the developer on a specific goal that will lead to making the desired changes in a efficient way.
