			The first main difference between functional and OOP(object oriented programming) is the way variables are treated.<br>
			Normally we would take one variable and change its values througout the program.<br>
			var = an array # [x, y, z, r]<br>
			var gets more elements as the array is used, reused, and manipulated.<br>
			In a functional program the array would just be renamed as it is manipulated and changed.<br>
			var = an array<br>
			var1 = that array plus additional elements
			var3 = var1 changed again

			There are a few different things to consider when evaluating the difference between functional and OOP.  OOP is really based on the idea of taking different algorithims and manipulating data using said algorithims as a way to get data through a set of steps.<br>
			In functional programming the style either creates new functions, output the desired answer, or finds the value of an expression.

			If I were functional programming my evaluation would be lazier than in OOP.  The lazy evaluation method, variable, or function only wants to know as much information as it absoluty needs to get the desired output.  This makes the code much more DRY and compact.  <br>
