			One of the biggest problems in the tech industry, especially affecting mobile dev, is a lack of programming talent.  The following chart was provided thanks to Indeed.com and shows the overall job posting growth for HTML5 over the last couple years.

			One thing has been very prevelant in each article, post, or review I have read about this shortage.  It always refers to "good" programming talent.  It looks as though this problem is due to an ever expanding marketplace for mobile and web applications that can help companies or individuals become more: connected, efficient, informed, and educated.
		</p>	
		<p>
			<strong>So what can we do to help solve this problem?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Luckily for the tech industry their are several new companies that are out to help solve this problem.  They are educating new programmers with skills and industry best practice as so they can immediately become a part of the thriving tech community as soon as possible.  Companies like DevBootcamp are offering to make you a web programmer within as little as nine weeks of onsite work.  They are even able to leverage their relationships to help find work and talent relationships that are mutually beneficial.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I think this is the best way to start to stop the bleed out of unfulfilled projects and opportunities in the tech industry and companies like this will help us to rethink education and its current archaic methodologies.
