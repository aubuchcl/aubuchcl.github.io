			A long long time ago in a galaxy relative near... well actually on earth computer programming was born.  On a very basic level it was done in the 1800's, but for this report we will focus on applicable transitions.  
		</p>
		<p>
			At first to program a computer all code was written in binary.  This would have made our 9 week period pretty intense considering the mathematical competency needed to make things work.  We refer to this type of coding as machine language as the programmers of that era were writing code that could be directly read by the computer.  
		</p>
		<p>
			And then the almighty assembler was born.  With the assembly language programmers could use words to code such as add, subtract, etc.  They would then use an assembler to translate these words back to machine language.  This was somewhere around the 40s.  The cool thing was that all labels were global :).

			From this era we have moved into high level languages.  These languages rely on a compiler to translate the code we write in our text editors and consoles to the machine language.  You could make the arguement that some high level languages are interpreted or do not need the use of a compiler to run on the computer, but I would make the arguement that the compiler for these languages is just running in the backgroud.  It would be like speaking to someone that speaks more languages than you do.  They could understand your language but also others.  Some languages they may need to write down and translate, such as pig latin.  Others they just know.  These individuals would understand the langage but only on the idea that they understood the vocabulary and at some point their brain has to break down the words into meanings.  I think this is realative to compiled vs interpreted languages.    
		</p>

			One of the most famous and first high level language was FORTRAN which was developed by IBM.  This language lead to the development of languages like COBOL, Basic, Java, Javascript, C, C+, C++, HTML, and all of todays useful coding languages.

			So where will computer programming go next?  We are living in an everchanging environment of innovation.  There are so many new things being brought to the market due to the abundance of homes with high speed internet.  We will see things like networked thermostats, tvs, ovens, smart watches, smart glasses, and maybe even smart alarm clocks that wont let me snooze 15 times in a row.  The product market will continue to drive a need for more efficient and evolvable code that will lead to the creation of new languages and maybe, someday, a language that will allow us to directly communicate to the computer.  Only time will tell, unless we invent a time machine.
