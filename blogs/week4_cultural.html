			The last conflict I had has been this week.  My wife and I are in the middle of moving from our home to a condo.  We have moved forward our move out date to help our landlord get his home on the market asap and this has placed a lot of stress on our current situation because we both work full time and have other responsibilities.  I think that the main source of the conflict isn't the actual work itself, but the idea that their is a chance we may not get all of it done.  Generally, I have been handling myself somewhat poorly in this situation.  My wife continually says I am not doing anything "productive", when I clearly am and so instead of trying to understand what she may really be saying, I have been ignoring her.  We still have a few days, so my goal is to start to reiterate what she is saying to me so that she knows that I hear what she is saying, but maybe then she will understand that she may be using the wrong words to express what it is she wants.  I have learned a lot from this experience.  I would say that overall, I need to immediately reflect on things by writing down what is happening.  This process helps me to be more objective about the situation and calms some of the other feelings I have when we are in the midst of the arguement or conflict.
