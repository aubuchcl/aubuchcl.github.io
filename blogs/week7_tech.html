			<strong>What is SQL injection</strong><br>
			SQL injection is when someone maliciously enters information into a field that will potentially cause submission of said form to delete, drop, or dump parts or all of the database.  This will generally happen when an application doesnt properly validate the data being submitted by a user.  It is a problem because the attacks can reveal information that should otherwise be secured in the database such as personal social security numbers, bank accounts, and so on.  The only way to combat something like this is to have validation measures.  To validate the  data you must limit the input that can be submitted by users.  As a newb it would be important to focus on what imputs can be submitted.  I dont think that any of the other options made any sense.

			<strong>SQL or NoSQL That is the question</strong><br>
			SQL databases use relational databases and code to store and pull information from giant stacks of tables, rows, and columns.  This is executed using joins, unions, etc to relate the tables, rows, and columns together.  <br>

			NoSQL isnt really anything specific as it is an idea.  It is the group of database technologies that basically, isnâ€™t SQL.  It was started, mostly, by Amazon and Google, but has been adopted by lots of people, most of whom tend not to like SQL for various (or obvious) reasons.<br>

			I am excited to dive heavily into SQL.  It has been around for a long time and holds all the secrets to relational data storage that I think I could handle for a while.  That being said, I am also most excited about SQL because if NoSQL became the staple of the world DB management then knowing a lot about SQL would give invaluable insight into the world created out of not using it.

			<strong>A beginners optimization</strong><br>
			There are several tools available to optimize your queries.  I looked through a msdn site the said to use a profiler and an optimization tool etc.  I would say that as a beginner in SQL I would probably try and look at my queries and try to DRY them up a little.  If I could look at my basic queries and do this I think that using a tool to do so would be much easier down the road, when looking at much more complex queries.
