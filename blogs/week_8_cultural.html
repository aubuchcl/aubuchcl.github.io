			<strong>First Impressions</strong><br>
			First impressions of something are a sensitive subject.  I don't really know how I feel about the DBC experience or what to expect.  I am feeling a melancholy that I think is inspired by the amount of anxiety and excitement being nearly equal.  I think the experience will be life changing.  I can say that with confidence.  When I moved to the west coast from the midwest to become a ski instructor, I was in a similar boat.  I had never taught a thing in my life and I was working with a two week program that was an intensive style similar to DBC.  I was feeling somewhat similar to how I feel now, but I at that point knew one thing: This experience will change my life.  On an objective basis, I do like the layout of the program.  I think it is aggressive enough to keep a high valence of performance and structured enough to deliver on its goals.  The curriculum seems relevant and well thought out.  I am excited to live in San Fran because, I believe, it is the epicenter of technology right now.  <br>

			<strong> What are my impressions of DBC </strong><br>
			Right now I am thinking of DBC as an opportunity.  Its like an empty box that I can fill with experiences and opportunity.  So I guess I don't really have a impresssion of DBC right now.  <br>
			<br><br>
			<strong>How will I engage</strong><br>
			I see myself engaging with DBC the same way as I engaged with roller coasters when I was a kid.  It was scary, but seemed fun and I didn't want to miss it.  So you strap in and hold on and when you get scared you try not to think about it.  When I am done I am sure that I will be super excited and ready to move onto the next coaster.  Each time I complete a coaster I was less scared and more prepared for the next and thats how I feel each week/phase will go.  I don't know what else I could say about how I will respond or engage.  I guess at least its not highlander.
