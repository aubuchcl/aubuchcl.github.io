			After taking the test about mind styles I scored highest in Abstract random.  This mind style was first only by a few points but I think it is a somewhat accurate description.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Abstract Random</strong><br>
			<strong>This learner likes:</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>.    to listen to others</li>
				<li>.   bringing harmony to group situations</li>
				<li>.    establishing healthy relationships with others</li>
				<li>.    focusing on the issues at hand</li>
			</ul><br>
			<strong>They learn best when</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>.   in a personalized environment</li>
				<li>.    given broad or general guidelines</li>
				<li>.    able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
				<li>.    able to participate in group activities</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>What's hard for them?</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>.    Having to explain or justify feelings</li>
				<li>.    Competition</li>
				<li>.    Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities </li>
				<li>.    Working in a restrictive environment</li>
				<li>.    Working with people who don't seem friendly</li>
				<li>.    Concentrating on one thing at a time</li>
				<li>.    Giving exact details</li>
				<li>.    Accepting even positive criticism</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>
				I definitely like to bring harmony to a group.  I think a group of satiated individuals works much smoother, almost like an engine with oil(vs one without).  This is based around the third point being relative as well.  The relationships in the group must be healthy.  To me, this means that I don't look to manipulate or passively agress people into harmony, but instead try to create a situation that works well with each person and listen closely to what they have to say.
			</p>
			<p>
				I definitely work best when I am able to participate in group activities.  I think the other three points are effective at describing me sometimes, but not always.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would agree that working in a restrictive environment is definitely contrary to the style of grouping I like to do.  I know that concentrating on one thing at a time is something I am poor at but I also am working toward being better at it as I see it as something that is necessary to good work as an engineer.  I would like to be much better at giving exact details as well but I do feel like I can take criticism(although this is getting better solely due to practice).
