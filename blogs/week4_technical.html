			Taking a closer look at enumerable#group_by shows that we can use group_by to take a set of values, be passed some directions (in a block) and return a hash, the values of which will be dependent on how you structure your block arguments.

			Above you can see exactly how group_by works.  It takes the numbers between 0 and 100 and returns a hash that is sorted by the remainder of dividing these numbers by 10.  This could be helpful especially if you were working with 10 or 15,000 times that much data.

			This is a cool way to randomly sort data as to return random groups.  Group_by is a great tool to give sets of data a familiar value to work off of and can be a great starting point when sorting or trying to find which values work together.
