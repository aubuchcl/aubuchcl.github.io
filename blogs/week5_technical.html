		<strong>Can data structures, objects, and classes really model real world objects?</strong>	
		</p>
		<p>
			When we speak about the things we interact with through our senses we speak similarly to the way we classify things in programming.  If you say that I see that the willows are all changing color, you are saying that all the instances of willow, in the class tree are changing their color variable to something that is not green.  
	    We speak in terms that may seem abstract to us or even whimsical.  
		</p>
		<p>
	    We talk in ways that actually represent a deep understanding of the objects around us, yet do to the human ability to make “judgements” or “interpretations” it goes largely unnoticed.  Say you are walking down the street and a car drives by and stops at a stop sign.  You look up and notice that it is a 80’s camaro.  The data structure of the human mind can, at this point, be compared to programming, classes, and data structures.  In just an instant your brain has accessed its car class found the instance method or instance variable related to car type, age of car, etc.  Real world objects are more closely related to the way we create them in software than we can ever really imagine.  This should be something to consider when learning about classes and data structures.

			<strong>So when do we use a class?</strong> <br>I would say I think about using a class when I know that I want to manipulate data in a more abstract way than just a method or two.  I would suggest starting your journey into classes by creating new instance method's of already defined class's such as Array.  Below you will find a quick brain bender on how to use your newly created class.

			So when you have some data that needs to be modified in more ways than a simple method can handle, go ahead and create a class.  You can name it something similar to what the expected problem it will solve is going to be or what is stored inside (ex class Animal or class BaseballStatsMaximizer).  Specific documentation on Class can be found on ruby docs as well.  Make sure to read through every line of the Class section of ruby docs before you try to get started writing your classes.  It might seem tedious, but the repetitive nature of this task will help align you with what to expect when trying to complete a new Class in ruby.
