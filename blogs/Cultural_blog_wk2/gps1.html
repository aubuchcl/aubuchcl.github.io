        Outside of programming I spend a lot of time skiing and I am a big fan of a few online games.  I spent the last five years teaching skiing professionally and hope to continue to ski for the rest of my life.  As for the games I play:  Right now I am pretty caught up in League of Legends and Hearthstone, but I still make time for Diablo.

      <p>
        I want to become a web applications programmer beacuse I spent my undergrad studying entrepreneurship and I think that technology is the best sector.  I learned something important though (I graduated in 08).  I learned that venture firms at the time wanted you to have more than an idea.  They wanted you to have the mental capacity to work that idea into a business and in the tech industry that meant understanding the code.  Yes there were some tech entrepreneurs who couldn't write code but I didn't want to be one of them.  So I took a couple years to go ski and now here I am ready to learn more.

        Pair programming is the activity of pairing with someone to work through an exercise or challenge.  It is based around the idea of haveing one person as a driver and one as a navigator.  The two positions are agreed on between the participants and are executed as follows.  The driver is responsible for leading on screen with typeing and formatting.  The navigator is responsible for guiding the driver if he/she steers off course etc.
