			Sterotype threat is when someone who is aware of a stereotype has the opportunity to make said sterotype true.  I am not sure I have ever really had stereotype threat effect me.  I dont really know any stereotypes that adhere to my life.  I guess that the closest I have gotten to stereotype threat is my own assertions of what I should be capable of completing or doing and knowing that I might not be able to live up to those expectations and then not doing so when I had the chance to perform well or quit.

			In contrast to stereotypes that might be negative to my social group, I was once in a fraternity.  During that time there were many situations where I had the opportunity to act in a way that could have been construed as stereotypical of a fraternity brother.  Maybe being really loud in a large group of brothers and drinking to much or being exclusive.  I dont think that at any time I had an idea that I may have acted one way or another based on what people may have expected me to do.  I didnt experience the effects of that expectation on my decision making in that time and I wasn't making decisions relative to others expectations of what my group would do, it was more based on what my friends and I thought we should do or what would be fun.

			Now that I am aware of stereotype threat I plan to act more cautiously with body language and how I expect people to act.  Hopefully when I do this it will allow others to feel more comfortable to act as they would naturally without the expectation of fulfilling how they might think I expect them to act.  I probably wont adress this in public.  If I did notice someone succumbing to this threat I would potentially have a talk with them in private but only to make sure that they were feeling comforable with themselves.
