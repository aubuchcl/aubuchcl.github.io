			What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
		</p>
		<p>
			I really enjoy pairing with others to solve challenges.  I’m not sure if it is the added valence of performing in front of another person, or if it is just that much easier to use two peoples ideas than just one persons idea
		</p>
		<p>
			Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
		</p>
		<p>
			The fun part was making light of our failures when code didn’t work as suspected.  The rewarding part was when the code finally worked.
		</p>
		<p>
			Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
		</p>
		<p>
			I don’t really have much programming experience before DBC, so it is frustrating for me when people seem to easily adapt to new concepts much faster than I do. 
		</p>
		<p>
			How did you feel when you read your feedback?
		</p>
		<p>
			I love getting feedback.  It makes me feel like I have a closer understanding of what I am doing right and wrong
		</p>
		<p>
			Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
		</p>
		<p>
			In this instance it was more a reiteration of what we had gone over at the end of our pairing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
		</p>
		<p>
			I was a little more focused and prepared. 
		</p>
		<p>
			How was it to write feedback?
		</p>
		<p>
			Interesting.  As a ski instructor, I had to give feedback daily.  It was interesting to try not to create the “bad” sandie.  It was almost more interesting to read other peoples feedback.
		</p>
		<p>
			What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
		</p>
		<p>
			Trying to give advice to someone who has a better understanding of the subject than I do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
		</p>
		<p>
			Pairing and group learning is why I came to DBC.  The idea of learning as a group and working together is what makes sense to me.  When coaching skiing, I realised that , learning something on your own is much much harder than learning with a group and a coach.  This really translates to all subjects and in my mind is the only way to learn.
