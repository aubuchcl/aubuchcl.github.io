			Humans, both as a group and individually, are sensitive beings.  We each start life believing our mothers.  Our mothers claim "You are the best" or "You will be the best", etc.  At some point we meet our peers.  Our peers mothers have told them the same thing and we interact.  At some point their will be a limited resource that will have to be taken, earned, or recieved by one of said two interacting people.  This creates a situation, where one will feel success and one may feel failure.  <br>
			This was a part of my journal reflection last week after I wrote about stereotype threat.  It went on to reflect on how over time the denial of success to the deserving may have been what created the assumption of an expected end or that part of stereotyping. <br>
			I guess what was most interesting was how quickly this can be overcome though awareness and affirmation.  By allowing people an open venue of actions where they feel they are not pigeonholed into acting a certain way they can reach the outcome of their desire and in that moment they can take steps away from the dangers of stereotype threat.  <br>
			When I meditate on these concepts or as I have there has really been one conclusion that I have come to, as it relates to how I will regulate my emotions at DBC.  I have come to the idea that information will be king and not what I think something might mean or what it could be.  I will work strictly on what is true and what is false.  I don't mean this in the most serious sense or that I wont be fun, nervous, excited, and anxious all at once.  I read an article about imposter syndrome (I think that was what it was called) that talked about how a ton of people are driving themselves crazy thinking that everyone else in the industry (tech engineers) are smarter, better, harder-working, etc and that their work is lacking.  So if I work off of the data and feedback provided and don't obsess over small potentials (what something could/might mean or be) I will be accomplishing two goals.  First, there is a better chance that I wont go crazy.  Second, my mind will move much farther toward the growth mindset and further from fixed.  In the fully activated growth mindset I should be excited to be working with, around, or at times against other great programmers.  Overall I think this will be a great approach.
