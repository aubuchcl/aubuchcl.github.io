			So you got yourself some data and you want to change, view, or in essence just “do something” to all or some of the data you have. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You have also chosen Ruby, because it is awesome and makes sense to you.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what do you do now?
		</p>
		<p>
			I would say that you have a lot of options, many more than I could ever cover in one blog post. So we will make an assumption here:
		</p>
		<p>
			Our assumption is this:  We want to loop through some data and we think that we want to use array#map but we are not sure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is how we will figure that out.
		</p>
		<p>
			Would you like to manipulate all the data in your set with the same amount of change?
			</p>
			<p> 
			If your answer is yes then feel free to fire away with your map iterator and you can add new data to all of your data points.
		</p>
		<p>
			What if I only want to change a couple items?
		</p>
		<p>
			Relax I'm getting to that!
		</p>
		<p>
			Is your data is all the same type and you only want to change a few different pieces?
		</p>
		<p>
			If so, you can still use map, but you have to use select to show map what values you would like to “map” the value change to.   (see example on link)
		</p>
		<p>
			Hey I heard people on stackoverflow talking about injecting this and injecting that.  Is that something that is viable here?
		</p>
		<p>
			Well lucky for you I am not J. Nicholson or I would say “You can’t handle the inject” :).
		</p>
		<p>
			Lets talk about what inject really is.  Inject, when I think about it, is like a legal arbitrator.  It has a value before it is called “[value].inject[value]” and one after.  It listens to both sides in a secret room |secret, room| and outputs a new value based on the desired arbitration rules that can be committed under the call.  If you are looking for a more tech version of this see the examples on the site I posted above.
